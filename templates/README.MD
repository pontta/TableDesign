# Equation Solver Web App

## Description
A Flask web application that solves equations and visualizes the results.

## Why Use a Virtual Environment?
Using a virtual environment is important because it allows you to create an isolated space for your project. This means that the dependencies for your project won't interfere with other projects or the global Python environment. It helps avoid version conflicts and makes your project easier to manage and deploy.

## Setting up virtual environment

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
